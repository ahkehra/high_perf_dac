#### High Performance DAC

#### - This module enables the "High Performance DAC" mode of Qualcomm's WCD9xx DAC to maximize its power and achieve the best audio quality possible.

##### • `Every phone powered by a Qualcomm processor has a built-in WCD9xx Audio DAC, but it is rarely configured to be used to its full potential by OEMs. By enabling High-Performance Mode, the audio quality of Qualcomm-powered devices will not only receive a boost in volume but will also sound clearer and crisper.`

##### • `Requires Kernel Support`

##### - INSTALLATION: Simply flash via any module manager and reboot.

###### Disclaimer: Naturally, you take all the responsibility for what happens to your device when you start messing around with things. I (Akera) will not be responsible for ANY damage caused to anyone's devices due to the use of this module.
